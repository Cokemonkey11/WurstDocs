# Enums

In Wurst, _Enums_ can be used to set up collections of named (int) constants.
These Constants can then be accessed via the Enum's name:
```wurst
enum State
	FLYING
	GROUND
	WATER

init
	State s = State.GROUND
```
You can also use enums inside of classes
```wurst
class C
	State currentState

	construct( State state )
		currentState = state
```
To check the current value of an enum, you can use the switch statement.
Note that all Enummembers have to be checked (or a defaut).
```wurst
switch currentState
	case State.FLYING
		print("flying")
	case State.GROUND
		print("ground")
	case State.WATER
		print("water")
```
In switch statements and variable assignments the qualifier can be ommited so you can also write:
```wurst
switch currentState
	case FLYING
		print("flying")
	case GROUND
		print("ground")
	case WATER
		print("water")
```

# Tuple Types

With _tuple_ types you can group several variables into one bundle. This can be used to return more than one value from a function, to create custom types and of course for better readability.

Note that tuples are not like classes. There are some important differences:
- You do not destroy tuple values.
- When you assign a tuple to a different variable or pass it to a function you create a copy of the tuple. Changes to this copy will not affect the original tuple.
- Tuple types cannot be bound to type parameters, so you can not have a List{vec} if vec is a tuple type.
- As tuple types are not created on the heap you have no performance overhead compared to using single variables.

```wurst
// Example 1:

// define a tuple
tuple vec(real x, real y, real z)

init
	// create a new tuple value
	vec v = vec(1,2,3)
	// change parts of the tuple
	v.x = 4
	// create a copy of v and call it u
	vec u = v
	u.y = 5
	if v.x == 4 and v.y == 2 and u.y == 5
		testSuccess()


// Example 2:

tuple pair(real x, real y)
init
	pair p = pair(1,2)
	// swap the values of p.x and p.y
	p = pair(p.y, p.x)
	if p.x == 2 and p.y == 1
		testSuccess()
```

Because tuples don't have any functions themselves, you can add extension
functions to an existing tuple type in order to achieve class-like
functionality.
Remember that you can't modify the value of a tuple in it's extension function
- so you have to return a new tuple every time if you wan't to change something.
Look at the Vector package in the Standard Library for some tuple usage
examples. (Math/Vectors.wurst)



# Extension Functions

Extension functions enable you to "add" functions to existing types without
creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original
type.
Extension functions are a special kind of static function, but they are called
as if they were instance functions of the extended type.

## Declaration
```wurst
public function TYPE.EXTFUNCTIONNAME(PARAMETERS) returns ...
	BODY
	// The keyword "this" inside the body refers to the instance of the extended type
```
## Examples

```wurst
// Declaration
public function unit.getX() returns real
	return GetUnitX(this)

// Works with any type
public function real.half() returns real
	return this/2

// Parameters
public function int.add( int value )
	return this + value

// Usage
unit u = CreateUnit(...)
...
print( u.getX().half() )

// Also classes, e.g. setter and getter for private vars
public function BlubClass.getPrivateMember() returns real
	return this.privateMember

// And tuples as mentioned above
public function vec2.lengthSquared returns real
	return this.x*this.x+this.y*this.y
```

# Lambdas and Closures

A lambda expression (also called anonymous function) is a lightweight way to provide an implementation
of a functional interface or abstract class (To keep the text simple, the following
explanations are all referring to interfaces, but abstract classes can be used in the same way).

A *functional interface* is an interface which has only one method.
Here is an example:
```wurst
// the functional interface:
interface Predicate<T>
	function isTrueFor(T t) returns bool

// a simple implementation
class IsEven implements Predicate<int>
	function isTrueFor(int x) returns bool
		return x mod 2 == 0

// and then we can use it like so:
let x = 3
Predicate<int> pred = new IsEven()
if pred.isTrueFor(x)
	print("x is even")
else
	print("x is odd")
destroy pred
```

When using lambda expressions, it is not necessary to define a new class
implementing the functional interface. Instead the only function of the
functional interface can be implemented where it is used, like so:
```wurst
let x = 3
// Predicate is defined here:
Predicate<int> pred = (int x) -> x mod 2 == 0
if pred.isTrueFor(x)
	print("x is even")
else
	print("x is odd")
destroy pred
```
The important part is:
```wurst
(int x) -> x mod 2 == 0
```
This is a lambda expression. It consists of two parts and an arrow symbol *->*
between the two parts. The left hand side of the arrow is a list of formal parameters,
as you know them from function definitions. On the right hand side there
is an expression, which is the implementation. The implementation consists only
of a single expressions, because lambda expressions are typically small and used
in one line. But if one expression is not enough there is the begin-end expression.

Remember that, because closures are just like normal objects, you also have to destroy them
like normal objects. And you can do all the other stuff you can do with
other objects like putting them in a list or into a table.


## begin-end expression

Sometimes one expression is not enough for a closure. In this case, the begin-end
expression can be used. It allows to have statements inside an expression. The
begin keyword has to be followed by a newline and an increase in indentation.
The rule that newlines are ignored inside parenthesis is ignored for the begin-end
expression, so that it is possible to have multiple lines of statements within:
```wurst
doLater(10.0, () -> begin
	KillUnit(u)
	createNiceExplosion()
	doMoreStuff()
end)
```
It is also possible to have a return statement inside a begin-end expression
but only the very last statement can be a return.


## Capturing of Variables


The really cool feature with lambda expressions is, that they create a *closure*.
This means that they can close over local variables outside their scope
and capture them.
Here is a very simple example:
```wurst
let min = 10
let max = 50
// remove all elements not between min and max:
myList.removeWhen((int x) ->  x < min or x > max)
```
In this example the lambda expression captured the local variables min and max.

It is important to know, that variables are captured by value. When a closure
is created the value is copied into the closure and the closure only works on that copy.
The variable can still be changed in the environment or in the closure, but this will have no effect
on the respective other copy of the variable.

This can be observed when a variable is changed after the closure is created:
```wurst
var s = "Hello!"
CallbackFunc f = () -> begin
	print(s)
	s = s + "!"
end
s = "Bye!"
f.run()  // will print "Hello!"
f.run()  // will print "Hello!!"
print(s) // will print "Bye!"
```

## Behind the scenes

The compiler will just create a new class for every lambda expression in your code.
This class implements the interface which is given by the context in which
the lambda expression is used.
The generated class has fields for all local variables which are captured.
Whenever the lambda expression is evaluated, a new object of the class is created
and the fields are set.

So the "Hello!" example above is roughly equivalent to the following code:
```wurst
// (the interface was not shown in the above code, but it is the same):
interface CallbackFunc
	function run()

// compiler creates this closure class implementing the interface:
class Closure implements CallbackFunc
	// a field for each captured variable:
	string s

	function run()
		// body of the lambda expression == body of the function
		print(s)
		s = s + "!"

var s = "Hello!"
CallbackFunc f = new Closure()
// captured fields are set
f.s = s
s = "Bye!"
f.run()  // will print "Hello!"
f.run()  // will print "Hello!!"
print(s) // will print "Bye!"
```
## Function types

A lambda expression has a special type which captures the type of the parameter
and the return type. This type is called a *function type*. Here are some examples with their type:
```wurst
() -> 1
	// type: () -> integer

(real r) -> 2*r
	// type: (real) -> real

(int x, string s) -> s + I2S(x)
	// type: (int,string) -> string
```

While function types are part of the type system, Wurst has no way to write down
a function type. There are no variables of type "(int,string) -> string".
Because of this, a lambda expression can only be used in places where
a concrete interface or class type is known.
This can be an assignment where the type of the variable is given.
```wurst
Predicate<int> pred = (int x) -> x mod 2 == 0
```
However it is not possible to use lambda expressions if the type of the variable is only inferred:
```wurst
// will not compile, error "Could not get super class for closure"
let pred = (int x) -> x mod 2 == 0
```
## Lambda expressions as code-type

Lambda expressions can also be used where an expression of type `code` is expected.
The prerequisite for this is, that the lambda expression does not have any parameters
and does not capture any variables. For example the following code is _not_ valid,
because the local variable `x` is captured.

```wurst
let t = getTimer()
let x = 3
t.start(3.0, () -> doSomething(x)) // error: Cannot capture local variable 'x'
```

This can be fixed by attaching the data to the timer manually:
```wurst
let t = getTimer()
let x = 3
t.setData(x)
t.start(3.0, () -> doSomething(GetExpiredTimer().getData()))
```
If a lambda expression is used as `code`, there is no new object created and
thus there is no object which has to be destroyed. The lambda expression will just
be translated to a normal Jass function, so there is no performance overhead when
using lambda expressions in this way.

# Function Overloading

Function overloading allows you to have several functions with the same name.
The compiler will then decide which function to call based on the static type
of the arguments.

Wurst uses a very simple form of overloading. If there is exactly one function in
scope which is feasible for the given arguments, then this function will be used.
If there is more than one feasible function the compiler will give an error.

Note that this is different to many other languages like Java, where the
function with the most specific feasible type is chosen instead of giving an error.
```wurst
function unit.setPosition(vec2 pos)
	...

function unit.setPosition(vec3 pos)
	...

function real.add(real r)
	...

function real.add(real r1, real r2)
	...
```
This works because the parameters are of different types or have a different amount of paramaters and the correct function can therefore be determined at compiletime.
```wurst
function real.add(real r1)
	...

function real.add(real r1) returns real
```
This does not work because only the returntype is different and the correct function cannot be determined.

```wurst
class A
class B extends A

function foo(A c)
	...

function foo(B c)
	...

// somewhere else:
	foo(new B)
```

This does not work either, because B is a subtype of A. If you would call the function foo
with a value of type B, both functions would be viable. Other languages just take the
"most specific type" but Wurst does not allow this. If A and B are incomparable types, the overloading is allowed.


# Operator Overloading

Operator Overloading allows you to change the behavior of internal operators +, -, \* and / for custom arguments.
A quick example from the standard library (Vectors.wurst):
```wurst
// Defining the "+" operator for the tupletype vec3
public function vec3.op_plus( vec3 v ) returns vec3
	return vec3(this.x + v.x, this.y + v.y, this.z + v.z)

// Usage example
vec3 a = vec3(1.,1.,1.)
vec3 b = vec3(1.,1.,1.)
// Without Operator Overloading (the add function was replaced by it)
vec3 c = a.add( b )
// With operator Overloading
vec3 c = a + b
```
You can overload operators for existing types via Extension-Functions or via class-functions for the specific classtype.
In order to define an overloading function it has to be named as following:
```wurst
+  "op_plus"
-  "op_minus"
*  "op_mult"
/  "op_divReal"
```
# Object Editing

Creating Object-Editor Objects via Wurst code.

*NOTE:* Object Editing hardly works at the moment, so you should only use it for fun but not for profit.
Do not use it for a real project yet!

## Compiletime Functions

Compiletime Functions are functions, that are executed when compiling your script/map.
They mainly offer the possibility to create Object-Editor Objects via code.

A compiletime function is just a normal Wurst function annotated with @compiletime.
```wurst
@compiltetime function foo()
```
Compiltetime functions have no parameters and no return value.

In order to run compiletime functions you have to enable the checkbox in the Wurstpack Menu.
When you use compiletime functions to generate objects, Wurst will generate the object files
next to your map and you can import them into your map using the object editors normal import
function. Compared to ObjectMerger this has the advantage, that you can directly see your new
objects in the object editor.
You can also enable an option to directly inject the objects into the map file, though the changes will not be visible in the object-editor directly.

You can use the same code during runtime and compiletime.
The special constant `compiletime` can be used to distinguish the two.
The constant is `true` when the function was called at compiletime and `false` otherwise.
The following example shows how this could be useful:
```wurst
init
	doInit()

@compiletime
function doInit()
	for i = 1 to 100
		if compiletime
			// create item object
		else
			// place item on map
```

### Object Editing Natives

The standard library provides some functions to edit objects in compiletime functions.
You can find the corresponding natives and higher level libraries in the objediting folder of the standard library.

The package ObjEditingNatives contains natives to create and manipulate objects. If you are familiar with
the object format of Wc3 and know similar tools like [Lua Object Generation](http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/jass-ai-scripts-tutorials-280/lua-object-generation-191740/)
or the ObjectMerger from JNGP, you should have no problems in using them. If you run Wurst with compiletime functions enabled, it will generate
the object creation code for all the objects in your map. This code is saved in files named similar to "WurstExportedObjects_w3a.wurst.txt" and
can be found right next to your map file. You can use this code as a starting point if you want to use the natives.

Wurst also provides a higher level of abstraction. For example the package AbilityObjEditing provides many classes
for the different base abilities of Wc3 with readable method names. That way you do not have to look up the IDs.

The following example creates a new spell based on "Thunder Bolt". The created spell has the ID "A005".
In the next line the name of the spell is changed to "Test Spell".
Level specific properties are changed inside the loop.
```wurst
package Objects
import AbilityObjEditing

@compiletime function myThunderBolt()
	// create new spell based on thunder bolt from mountain king
	let a = new AbilityDefinitionMountainKingThunderBolt("A005")
	// change the name
	a.setName("Wurst Bolt")
	a.setTooltipLearn("The Wurstinator throws a Salami at the target.")
	for i=1 to 3
		// 400 damage, increase by 100 every level
		a.setDamage(i, 400. + i*100)
		// 10 seconds cooldown
		a.setCooldown(i, 10.)
		// 0 mana, because no magic is needed to master Wurst
		a.setManaCost(i, 0)
		// ... and so on
```

*NOTE* There are also packages for other object types, but those packages are even more WIP.



## Automated Unit Tests

You can add the annotation @test to a function. Then when you type "tests" into the Wurst Console all functions
annotated with @test are executed.

You have to import the Wurstunit package to use functions like assertEquals.

Example:
```wurst
package Test
import Wurstunit

@test public function a()
	12 .assertEquals (3*4)

@test public function b()
	12 .assertEquals (5+8)
```
If you run this, you get the following output:
```wurst
> 1+1
res = 2     // integer
> tests
1 tests OK, 1 tests failed
function b (Test.wurst, line 8)
	test failed: expected 13 but was 12
	at stmtreturn  (.../lib/primitives/Integer.wurst, line 25)
>
```
The first line is just to check whether the console is working ;)

You can search the standard library for "@test" to get some more examples.
